# Classification for Human Activity Recognition from the linear accelerometer data

Training and test data for the classification of human activity types (rest, walking, running) was collected using a linear accelerometer built into a smartphone.

To solve the problem of classification based on the data of the axes of the linear accelerometer, the bidirectional LSTM Networks neural network model was used.
