# Classification for Human Activity Recognition from the linear accelerometer data

Data collection (training and test data) for the classification of human activity types (rest, walking, running) was carried out using a linear accelerometer built into a smartphone.

To solve the problem of classification based on the data of the axes of the linear accelerometer, the bidirectional LSTM Networks neural network model was used.
